# Introduction

For Caltech Control and Dynamical System (CDS) PhD students, Qualifying Exams are taken at the end of the second quarter and cover the following topics:

- One of: CMS 117 (Probability Theory) or CMS 122 (Mathematical Optimization)
- CDS 131 (Linear Systems)
- CDS 232 (Nonlinear Dynamics)

The structure of the exams is as follows: the student is given a paper exam consisting of three sections (corrosponding the the subjects listed above). Each section of the exam is written by that year's instructor of the corrosponding course. The parts typically have around 3 questions (with possible subquestions). The student is given one hour and thirty minutes to prepare, and then one hour to present solutions to the proctors (made up of some subset of professors in the CDS department). The solution presentation is done on the whiteboard, and is sort of 'adaptive difficulty' - the proctors will ask questions probing the edge of the student's understanding. This can be guiding questions if the subject matter is difficult, or challenging questions (potentially going beyond the written exam) if the original question is handled with ease.

Each section of the exam must be independently passed. Grades given on each section are selected from pass, conditional pass (passing, but may require additional action such as TAing the class a following year) and fail. Sections which are failed must be retaken at the beginning of the summer. The fail rate historically hovers around 1/3 (for each subject), but on the second attempt students almost always pass (at least conditionally). I was lucky enough to pass all three sections on my first attempt, and I chose CMS 122 for my first section.
